The emperor is far from good, but this will cause a ruckus for cycles if Mur is successful.'' We objectively know that he's only doing this so MurcuryBios has more power in the solar system. More power equals more money and so on, a Fortuna's only purpose in life. </p>"
	document.getElementById("option1").innerHTML += "<p>''Okay, well, I guess it would be easier if you both helped. But, why would you?'' I jump in before Eva can get all sappy.</p>"
	document.getElementById("option1").innerHTML += "<p>''He hasn't paid us, and I have a feeling he's not the kind of guy too pay us. If you get what I mean.'' She smirked. She absolutely knew what I meant.</p>"
	document.getElementById("option1").innerHTML += "<p>''What made you go against Mur?'' Eva asks out of the blue.</p>"
	document.getElementById("option1").innerHTML += "<p>''I didn't agree with it, he tricked me into doing some of the work, so I did what any respectable woman would do, and did a runner.'' I like her. She's smart. She's also a good cook.</p>"
	document.getElementById("option1").innerHTML += "<p>We all spent the next few hours talking and coming up with a plan to stop Mur without causing too much of a commotion. The plates were piled to the side of the coffee table, long forgotten. It seemed like a double edged sword. That is, until Ros had a breakthrough.</p>"
	document.getElementById("option1").innerHTML += "<p>''His brother!'' She half-shouted. ''His brother absolutely despises him, thinks that he would make a better company head. He's also married to a relative of the Emporer, so a plat would be unlikely from him.</p>"
	document.getElementById("option1").innerHTML += "<p>''We would just need to find a way to contact him...'' I deliberate. It was a damned good plan, but if that backfired it would backfire hard. We just need to hope the brothers haven't made amends behind closed doors.</p>"
	document.getElementById("option1").innerHTML += "<p>''I could do that!'' Eva perked up, happy to be useful. Ros led us down into the bedroom and through what you would think to be a closet, but was a computer room.</p>"
	document.getElementById("option1").innerHTML += "<p>Eva immediately got to it with Ros' help. I was pretty useless at the minute so I held back and made sure Ros wasn't gonna pull any crap on us again. She seemed lighter now, less ominous.</p>"
	document.getElementById("option1").innerHTML += "<p>By the morning I woke up from the couch to see the girls getting on, discussing some thing or another. Once I had had a minute or two I could hear that it was a meet up with Mur's brother they were discussing. This peaked my interest. </p>"
	document.getElementById("option1").innerHTML += "<p>''Did ya manage to get him?'' I say turning to the pair of them</p>"
	document.getElementById("option1").innerHTML += "<p>''Of course we did, no thanks to you'' Eva snarked jokingly.</p>"
	document.getElementById("option1").innerHTML += "<p>''You honestly think I coulda helped with that shit?'' They huffed in amusement.</p>"
	document.getElementById("option1").innerHTML += "<p>They were packing by the looks. I guess we were off. I soon joined them in gathering and organising our things. Found a whole outfit change in the wardrobe too, thank Jupiter for that.</p>"

	document.getElementById("option2").innerHTML += "<p>''Well, I wasn't going to let you kill her.''</p>"
	document.getElementById("option2").innerHTML += "<p>I walk over to her body and pull her Mindchip out of the slot in the back of her neck. Could be useful. As I walk back over to Eva I motion for her to leave the room. We walk past the streets the way we came, I put in an anonymous call notifying authorities of the body. No one would care to ask how or why once they discover who she is. I wasn't worried.</p>"
	document.getElementById("option2").innerHTML += "<p>Eva pinged Mur with a copy of her memory of the incident as proof.</p>"
	document.getElementById("option2").innerHTML += "<p>''He's sent us co-ordinates, its an upstate bar by the central hub.'' </p>"
	document.getElementById("option2").innerHTML += "<p>We travel back in silence. The buzz of the ship seemed slower than usual. Eva was acting off, understandably. But she wasn't even looking at me. We had grown close these past few weeks. Perhaps 'friends' even. I didn't have many of those, it was all business usually. Ah well, It was probably the first time she had seen someone die in person. </p>"
	document.getElementById("option2").innerHTML += "<p>As we approach the bar the smell of food wafted through all the ventilation units and through the air. Both our stomachs growled loudly. She looked over to me shyly and walked through the main entrance. An employee dressed to the nines stopped us at the entrance.</p>"
	document.getElementById("option2").innerHTML += "<p>''Names.'' Jupiter and Juno, now let us in fuck face. </p>"
	document.getElementById("option2").innerHTML += "<p>''Eva and uh.. Viewer.'' Damned right thats a cool-ass name. The employee gave us weird looks as they moved to the side and let us through.</p>"
	document.getElementById("option2").innerHTML += "<p>''Mer is in the private room, Von will show you the way up'' 'Von' A robot waiter walks towards the warm lit, open stairs. The bar was busy, but the atmosphere was relaxed and upmarket. We stood out like a sore thumb. Nervously looking around I followed Von and Eva up the stairs to the private dining halls. Not before checking the exits in case we needed it.</p>"
	document.getElementById("option2").innerHTML += "<p>We were led to a room at the back. The pit at the bottom of my gut grew, sending Eva a ping I messaged.</p>"
	document.getElementById("option2").innerHTML += "<p>'You feeling okay about this?'</p>"
	document.getElementById("option2").innerHTML += "<p>'No, lets just get it over and done with.'</p>"
	document.getElementById("option2").innerHTML += "<p>We didn't hesitate as we walked in and sat in the empty seats with Mur. The waiter shut the door as he left. The room was cosy, and food was laid out for us all, Mur having already helped himself. We sat down and also started piling our plates while exchanging greetings. Well, it would be rude not too we barely got to eat anything at Ros'.</p>"
	document.getElementById("option2").innerHTML += "<p>''Good job guys. But we still have to close some ties, yanno? How much did she tell you when you found her?'' Our faces dropped slightly as we processed what Mur was asking.</p>"
	document.getElementById("option2").innerHTML += "<p>''You saw what happened, she didn't get the chance.'' I spoke without conveying anything. God I hope he believes us. He faltered slightly. He doesn't believe us. God we're screwed. Eva didn't notice, I didn't have the heart to tell her.</p>"
	document.getElementById("option2").innerHTML += "<p>''Good, quick and sophisticated, I like it. Her mindchip?'' Eva hands it over. Sliding it across the table, nice and clean. </p>"
	document.getElementById("option2").innerHTML += "<p>''Its there, untampered. Our payment?'' Eva boldly asks, I really did do a number on her. </p>"
	document.getElementById("option2").innerHTML += "<p>''Transferred to your accounts. Enough to set you up for a couple cycles.'' Mur gets up leaving his food half eaten.</p>"
	document.getElementById("option2").innerHTML += "<p>We sat in silence for a few, he was always in a rush it seemed. Then everything went black as the last thing I heard was two silencer shots ring out. There was no mo...</p>"

	<h1>Moving upwards...or downwards?</h1>
	<p>De ja vu is the feeling, Ros is the name. I (unknowingly once again) kick the door down and we both rush in to her on a sofa eating dinner. She looks exasperated at the site of us.</p>
	<p>"Oh for fuck's sake."</p>
	<p>"That's what I said. Now, I'm feeling like we've been here before, why don't you invite us for dinner right now and we see what on Titan is going on." I wasn't taking any chances this time, one time is enough. I grab the bag that was sat next to her and hurl it across the room, motion for Eva to walk in. She does so cautiously. I walk over to the barley lived in kitchen and grab the rest of the food on the stove and two plates, dump it down on the coffee table and turn to Ros.</p>
	<p>"No one is leaving this time. Either you are going to give us our memory back, or you're going to explain everything again." She sighs and touches a implant below her Mindchip. Weird, I didn't know they made extra bits, will have to look into that. We hear the beeping again and both our faces drop simultaneously. Ros sees this and stammers.</p>
	<p>"I'm uploading your memory! Dont worry, I'm not trying anything I promise."  </p>
	<p>It was a weird feeling remembering something out of the blue. One that needed to be pushed back as I focused on Ros.</p>
	<p>"Good of you, that." Eva piped up sarcastically. She looked less than impressed at the whole ordeal. So, we ere in the thick of a plot to overthrow the Emperor. Thats fun...</p>
	<p>Should we just kill her and get this whole ordeal over with, maybe save our own asses, or do we do what's morally right and stop this unnecessary plot that's only going to cause a massive disturbance for the ship?</p>
