As I walk back over to Eva I motion for her to leave the room. We walk past the streets the way we came, I put in an anonymous call notifying authorities of the body. No one would care to ask how or why once they discover who she is. I wasn't worried.</p>"

	document.getElementById("option2").innerHTML += "<p>We travel back in silence. The hyper-train seemed slower than when we first got on. Eva was acting off, understandably. But she wasn't even looking at me. We had grown close these past few weeks. Perhaps 'friends' even. I didn't have many of those, it was all business usually. Ah well, It was probably the first time she had seen someone die in person. </p>"
	document.getElementById("option2").innerHTML += "<p>As we approach the bar the smell of the ethnic food wafted through all the ventilation units and through the air. Both our stomachs growled loudly. She looked over to me shyly and walked through the main entrance. An employee dressed to the nines stopped us at the entrance.</p>"
	document.getElementById("option2").innerHTML += "<p>''Names.'' Jupiter and Juno, now let us in fuck face. </p>"
	document.getElementById("option2").innerHTML += "<p>''Eva and uh.. Viewer.'' Damned right thats a cool-ass name. The employee gave us weird looks as they moved to the side and let us through.</p>"
	document.getElementById("option2").innerHTML += "<p>''Mer is in the private room, Caw will show you the way up'' 'Caw' A robot waiter walks towards the warm lit, open stairs. The bar was busy, but the atmosphere was relaxed and upmarket. We stood out like a sore thumb. Nervously looking around I followed Caw and Eva up the stairs to the private dining halls. Not before checking the exits in case we needed it.</p>"
	document.getElementById("option2").innerHTML += "<p>We were led to a room at the back. The pit at the bottom of my gut grew, sending Eva a ping I messaged.</p>"
	document.getElementById("option2").innerHTML += "<p>'You feeling okay about this?'</p>"
	document.getElementById("option2").innerHTML += "<p>'No, lets just get it over and done with.'</p>"
	document.getElementById("option2").innerHTML += "<p>We didn't hesitate as we walked in and sat in the empty seats with Mur. The waiter shut the door as he left.  The room was cosy, and food was laid out for us all, Mur having already helped himself. We sat down and also started piling our plates while exchanging greetings. Well, it would be rude not too.</p>"
	document.getElementById("option2").innerHTML += "<p>''Good job guys. But we still have to close some ties, yanno? How much did she tell you when you found her?'' Our faces dropped slightly as we processed what Mur was asking.</p>"
	document.getElementById("option2").innerHTML += "<p>''You saw what happened, she didn't get the chance.'' I spoke without conveying anything. God I hope he believes us. </p>"
	document.getElementById("option2").innerHTML += "<p>''Good, quick and sophisticated, I like it. Her mindchip?'' Eva hands it over. Sliding it across the table, nice and clean. </p>"
	document.getElementById("option2").innerHTML += "<p>''Its there, untampered. Our payment?'' Eva boldly asks, I really did do a number on her. </p>"
	document.getElementById("option2").innerHTML += "<p>''Transferred to your accounts. Enough to set you up for a couple cycles.'' Mur gets up leaving his food half eaten. ''I'll be in contact If I need anything else done.'' Oh god. We did too good of a job. </p>"
	document.getElementById("option2").innerHTML += "<p>We finished off the food and ate in silence... I guess this was the end? The contract was closed, Ros had been dispatched. Perhaps Eva and I could have worked together a bit longer if we had trusted Ros. Thats the price you pay for your head though I guess. It sure would have been suicidal to get in the middle of that plot.</p>"

	<h1>Station Terra</h1>	
	<p>"Wanna know something?" I hear still sat, now laying vertically on the couch. </p>
	<p>"Not really" My curt reply is rewarded with an eyeroll as Eva sips on some water, leaning on the counter. We both were looking rough. Sweat lined our faces and my spine was still spasming every few minutes.</p>
	<p>"Whilst she was in our brains I got a trace of her direct location" I shot up as fast as light. No she didn't.</p>
	<p>"You're lying." She shook her head, looking very pleased with herself.</p>
	<p>"Nope. Station Terra. I don't know the geography quite well, but it looks like she was on what used to be a country named Swe-den?" Oh my gosh. She really isn't lying. I ran over to her...well, it was more like a fast hobble. For the first time in a long time, I hugged her. </p>
	<p>"I have severely underestimated you Eva" It was perfect timing. In a few solar days there was a shuttle to the surface. Just enough time to prepare and say any goodbyes. We would have to get the shuttle to Station Tellus, and then from there to Station Terra.</p> 
	<p>Fast forward to take off day </p>
	<p>"Hurry the fuck up Eva"</p>
	<p>"Fuck off Cyclops" My eyes widened slightly. God I hope I'm not rubbing off on her. We boarded the stuffy packed ship. Got a few weird looks, and found some seats in the back of the ship. </p>
	<p>The ride was loud and uncomfortable, but it was over shortly. Travelling to Station Terra was much easier than I had remembered the first time around. Mind you that was a very long time ago. They seem to have updated the rail lines to hyperlines. Made with the same thought of the shuttles. Though the atmosphere was still the same. We arrived around midday, though a thick blanket of smog covered the city, it most certainly was beautiful. The air was much fresher and people more sparse. </p>
	<p>I looked over to Eva who was carrying some kind of portable computer in her hand. I never much cared for the technology past implants, but it must be said, she has definitely found her calling. Eva was leading us to some kind of ping she was picking up, close to the location she had described after Ros' warning. Although it was days ago, it felt like weeks.</p>
	<p>We walked through the entrance to some bar and up a few flights of stairs to a grimy hotel room. Eva looked at me and pinged a message.</p>
	<p>'Kick the door in'</p>
	<p>Oh, okay then. I don't know what I was expecting, but it wasn't that. The door swung open with a booming smash as my foot launched forward. Ouch. Worth it, bet that looked cool as fuck.</p>
	<p>There was a woman looking at us in shock, is this Ros? She' couldn't be that dangerous and look that vulnerable. But her words gave us no doubt.</p>
	<p>"Hello Ros" Eva said, testing the waters. The woman turned to look at Eva and gave a sly expression.</p>
	<p>"Well, I certainly wasn't expecting this...Are you here to kill me? I'm unarmed." Eva answered before I could speak. Guess I'll just stand here lookin' pretty.</p>
	<p>"You can persuade us not too.. " Oh this is how she's playing it eh...</p>
	<p>"Well.. I take it the data dump wasn't enough for yous both...I'll explain properly. See.. Mur hired me to help with a 'business' development he had been working on. Run of the mill stuff, collecting data, processing. See...I promise I didn't know. He...He's trying to use his influence to undermine the emperor for the next spot in the elections next cycle. So... I know you have every reason to take me to the emperor, but.. I can be useful! I'm one of the best Neuromancer's this side of the solar system!"</p>
	<p>"You think the emperor sent us?" Was all I could think to say... She has about as much of an idea as we do...Or she's manipulating us, Neuromancer and all.</p>
	<p>Eva pings a message </p>
	<p>'Do we just kill her and get this over with? I don't think she's lyin' might be best if we just kill her and get the job over and done with.'</p>
	<p>God she is getting too much like me. Or maybe I'm turning soft.</p>
