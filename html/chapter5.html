	<h1>Error 404</h1>
	<p>"Oh for fucks sakes..." My head was pounding faster than a hundred chariots. I looked around the dark room for any sign of Eva...Or a light switch.  Tripping over my feet a couple of times and feeling up the walls. My hands land on a button. Pressing said button activates the lightbulbs that show what kind of a hole we've dug ourselves into.</p>
	<p>The last thing I remembered was leaving for Station Terra and how Ros had invaded our minds. Looking around the room, it seemed like it was some kind of run down motel. Ah! Eva! Hobbling over to her passed out frame, I check for a pulse and move her to the bed situated in the middle of the room. How on Titan we got here I have no clue. But i do know that if we had come here, I would have woken up on that comfy looking bed or sofa, not on the cold wood floor. The could have at least had the decency to put Eva on the bed. Where's chivalry gone nowadays.</p>
	<p>She came to a couple of moments after being moved.</p>
	<p>"Do you remember anything that happened?" I say as soon as I see her eyes twitch open.</p>
	<p>"Ugh, no, I got nothing, you?" Shaking my head I move to search her bag that was thankfully with us. At least they hadn't robbed us.</p>
	<p>"Check your holopad. Do you think you could search the cctv in the area? I'm gonna go down to reception and have a lil chat with the receptionist." She nodded her head as she sat up. I grabbed my coat and headed out the door walking past people in the hallway. Terrans. So we had made it to Terra? Something really isn't right. Walking through the doorway with a large neon 'R ce ti n' sign hanging above I dive straight in for the kill, grabbing the receptionist, a scrawny, young looking man and shoving him through a smaller, employees only door. A quick jab to the face was all it took for him to begin spluttering. Guess he must have saw them drag us in here. </p>
	<p>"I don't know them I promise! I Swear! They we're just here with Ros!" Oh, so you do know them. A thought that I repeated aloud for once. He spluttered some more, then I felt wetness on my shoe. Please, gods tell me he hasn't. He has, Oh he really did. This time a punch to the gut, wrong choice, more piss joined the puddle. My hand immediately left his hold as I stepped back</p>
	<p>"You're a fucking mess. Just tell me exactly where they came from and went, then fuck off." </p>
	<p>"They came from that way" He said pointing to the road that leads downtown "And one of the muscle said something about getting back to some megacity ship before 'shit goes down'." Well then. Thank fuck for that, we're going back to The Titan. It was the only ship docked here for a few more weeks. I didn't bother replying and just left to go upstairs back to Eva. Shoes uncomfortably squelching all the way.</p>
	<p>"We're going back to the ship, forget the holopad." She looked at my wet, miserable and slightly bloodied state and thought better to ask questions. Good girl. </p>
	<p>AT THE LANDING BAY OF THE TITAN</p>
	<p>I slip the guard a Â£100 bill and show him the image of Ros that Mur had given us in the datadump. He sends a memory of them walking past dressed all covertly towards the family quaters on the east side of the ship. With a quick nod I grab Eva's attention and begin walking eastbound. Eva hacks into the cctv following Ros using the time the guard was able to give us. We soon find a run down quarter that I'm sure she had made very homely. </p>
