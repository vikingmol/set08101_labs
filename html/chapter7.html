	<h1>Penultimate</h1>
	<p>Walking to the place the girls had set up the meeting was tense but exciting. I couldn't really believe we'd made it this far in a contract as dangerous as this. It wasn't so much the physical danger but it was the nature of politicians and those in power that is truly frightening. This contract really knew how to make me paranoid.</p>
	<p>We arrived at was an older Templum, used as a praying site for the locals. It seemed to be in good nick. Unlike almost all places on the ship, it was near enough empty, save for the man kneeling in front of a marble like Jupiter tome, guess that's our guy. </p>
	<p>He stood as he heard us approach. Turning he nodded to Eva, Ros and I. This guy is cree-py. We followed him through to the back, behind the statue and through a open curved entry. He lowered his hood and motioned us to sit on a candle-lit table. "My brother is a fool, you were right to come to me" Okay cyberfreak. Way to make us feel comfortable with out choices.</p>
	<p>"I alone will arrange a meeting with him, Ros, you will tether to my mindchip and Eva, you will watch our backs. There is a datacentre underneath the Templum. You will both work from there. Viewer, you will go in behind me once Eva has taken the security down and clear the exit for our escape. Is this understood?" Hum, I guess that is a pretty good plan.</p>
	<p>The girls walked down where he directed and he turned to me.</p>
	<p>"I have some armoursuits and discreet weapons we can use. I would advise you to use them too."</p>
	<p>"Uh, yeah. Thanks, lead the way." We walked down the same hall as the others which diverged into two rooms, the other being a bedroom with a conjoined armoury. The man handed me an armoursuit and two small pistols to which I swiftly put on and clipped in.</p>
	<p>The guy and I left in a rush soon after. Personally I didn't see why we needed to rush. Mer's plan wasn't exactly, well, going to plan. Then again if this guy is his brother then he must know more than we do. I've learnt its best not to question things out loud.</p>
	<p>We arrived at the MurcuryBios HQ. It was as ominous as you'd expect, a black carbon tower climbing all the way us the ship, like the skyscrapers you'd see on Terra but stuck like a limpet to the outer walls of Titan.</p>
	<p>We walked through the front entrance through the wide glass doors, straight past all security, he pointed for me to take the side enterance up. I guess thats our escape route. Walking into the enterance I see a fire door to the rest of the ship, and stairs going up for miles.</p>
	<p>"Oh for fucks sake." Seemed to be my growing mantra. Not stairs, anything but stairs. Bastard did this on purpose. He's just fucking with me. Bet my eye he's up there with a cup of tea made from vesta's blood or something virginal. Freak. Buzzing the girls whilst walking up the stairs and peeking through the glass of each door the security cameras buzzed as they were damaged remotely. Fantastic. Pushing past the doors on each floor I took out anything that moved and tied the motionless bodies (still alive, we're classy here) to one another in a room. </p>
	<p>Walking up the stairs covertly to the penthouse where Mer should be speaking with his brother I lean against the door and try to listen in.  Only to hear the quite sounds of 
	kerfuffle and a thump. Job's done then I guess. Poking through the door quietly I crouch-walk through the corridor to see Mer on the floor with his brother on top of him.</p>
	<p>"oy oy"</p>
	<p>The comment was rewarded with a sharp glare. Then an even sharper tug on the cloth that was around Mer's neck. Lifting his lifeless body off the ground to stare pointedly in my direction. </p>
	<p>"Alright then..." I move towards Mer's body and consequently his psychopathic brother in a hesitant manner. Not unlike how you would approach a mange infested, but still cute dog. "Shall we go? The floors are cleared." </p>
	<p>"Not yet" </p>
	<p>Uh.. Okay then. Why is this guy so awkward? He walked over to what I assume is a bathroom. Daring to peek in, Mer's body was left hanging, a suicide. What kind of person could do this to their brother. Context or not, was this guy really a better replacement for Mer? What did Mer do to deserve this treatment from his own blood. Money and power seem to be terrifying motivators. But still, there must be something else. I'm not sure if I even want to know. </p>
	<p>After helping clear up a bit, we swiftly walked through the way I had previously cleared back to the Templum to see the girls. The girls were understandably very proud of themselves. I mean, they did wipe out one of the biggest buildings in The Titan for at least an hour, in waking time. That's pretty impressive. There was a quite buzz after all the excitement of the day. Then we focused on the television screen.</p>
	<p>The News reporters interrupted the advertising broadcasts on each and every billboard, screen and display with the news that the Co-founder and CEO of MurcuryBios has been discovered dead in his office. </p>
	<p>"The cause of death and whereabouts of the perpetrator's are currently unknown. Though we must announce that Mr Vitus' brother has taken up the duty of CEO as the other majority shareholder of the company." </p>
	<p>Well shit, that was quick. Contract closed I guess. Best we all stay away for a bit. Maybe lay low on Station Terra while everything dies down. Looking over to Mer's brother he had a hungry, deadish look on his face. What. Have. We. Done.</p>
